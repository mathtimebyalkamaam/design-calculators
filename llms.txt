# Design Calculators

## Project Overview
Design Calculators is a collection of free, web-based engineering calculators and tools for Electrical, Mechanical, and Instrumentation engineering. The tools are designed to comply with international standards such as IEC, IEEE, ISA, API, and ASME.

## Key Features
- **Electrical Engineering**: Tools for Arc Flash, Battery Sizing, Cable Sizing, Grounding, and more (IEC 60364, IEEE 80).
- **Instrumentation**: Calculators for Control Valves, Flow Metering, Level Measurement, and Safety Integrity Level (SIL).
- **Mechanical**: Tools for Pump Sizing, HVAC, Pipe Flow, and Stress Analysis.
- **Standards Compliance**: Built on IEC, IEEE, ISA, API, and ASME standards.
- **Technology**: Static HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. No build step required for most files.
- **Styles**: `styles.css` containing global styles, variables, and responsive design rules.
- **Scripts**: `main.js` and individual inline scripts for calculator logic.

## Directory Structure
- `/`: Root directory containing all HTML calculator pages.
- `styles.css`: Main stylesheet.
- `logo.png`, `favicon.ico`: Assets.
- `sitemap.xml`: SEO sitemap.

## Key Files
- `index.html`: Main landing page with navigation to all categories.
- `indexele.html`: Electrical section hub.
- `indexinst.html`: Instrumentation section hub.
- `indexmech.html`: Mechanical section hub.
